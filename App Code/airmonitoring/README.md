# Air Pollution Monitoring System

![Project Image](project_image.png)

> A real-time environmental data monitoring system that uses ESP32 as a remote sensor node to collect data from sensors such as DHT11, MQ135, BMP180, and more. The data is sent to a Flask server and made available to a Flutter app for real-time monitoring.

## Description

The Air Pollution Monitoring System is a project developed during an internship at Bharat Intern. It provides real-time environmental data using a network of sensors and IoT technologies.

Key features of the system include:

- **ESP32 Sensor Node**: ESP32 is used as a remote sensor node to capture data from various environmental sensors.

- **Sensor Integration**: The system interfaces with sensors such as DHT11, MQ135, BMP180, and more to collect a wide range of environmental data.

- **Flask Server**: A Flask server is used to receive and process the sensor data, making it accessible for further use.

- **Flutter App**: A Flutter application is developed to visualize and monitor the real-time sensor data.
